- **Put Delta**: Always negative for puts
- **Range**: 0 to 1 for calls, -1 to 0 for puts

#### **Gamma** (Delta Sensitivity):
- How much Delta changes per $1 stock move
- Higher Gamma = more risk and opportunity
- Most important for short-term options

#### **Theta** (Time Decay):
- **Daily Time Decay**: How much option loses value per day
- **Critical for Options Sellers**: Theta works in your favor
- **Accelerates Near Expiration**: Time decay increases

#### **Vega** (Volatility Sensitivity):

- **Important for Earnings Plays**: Volatility spikes expected

### 🎯 **Risk Analysis**:
- **Intrinsic Value**: What option is worth if exercised today
- **Time Value**: Premium above intrinsic value
- **Moneyness**: ITM (In-The-Money), ATM (At-The-Money), OTM (Out-Of-The-Money)
- **Probability ITM**: Statistical chance option expires in-the-money

### 💡 **Trading Recommendations**:
The calculator provides intelligent recommendations based on:
- **High Delta Calls** → Consider covered call strategies
- **Low Delta Calls** → Cheaper speculation, higher risk
- **High Time Decay** → Be aware of daily value loss
